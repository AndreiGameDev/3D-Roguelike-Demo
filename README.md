Controlls:

    Left Click to shoot
    Right Click for basically a stat booster(5s duration, 20s cooldown)
    Q for a kunai throw(10s duration cd)
    E for a dynamite throw(15s duration cd)
    F for interact
    Tab for crystal UI(to see how many crystals u have and of what type)
Settings and miscellaneous:

    Easy/Hard difficulty just amplifies how much damage u deal, easy = 2x, hard = 1x
    The rooms are procedurally generated with some hard set arenas being generated such as the beggining and anytime it takes curves to deal with infinite loops.

"Guide":

    The chest resets its ability to drop loot each time you clear a room, to finish a level you want to open the brown "door"(object) at the start which you are facing when you spawn in and then interact with the hatch("Black Object) to escape the level. 
    There is no finish line as I didn't have enough time to code it but you can get in and out of the level that way at any time as it is designed to be like risk of rain where u can extract at any time with whatever items you have.
